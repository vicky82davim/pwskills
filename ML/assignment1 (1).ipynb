More preciously, we can say; first, we train the machine with the input and \\ncorresponding output, and then we ask the machine to predict the output using the test dataset.\\nSupervised machine learning can be classified into two types of problems, which are given below:\\n•\\tClassification: Classification algorithms are used to solve the classification problems in which the output \\nvariable is categorical, such as “Yes” or No, Male or Female, Red or Blue, etc\\n•\\tRegression: Regression algorithms are used to solve regression problems in which there is a linear \\nrelationship between input and output variables. These are used to predict continuous output variables, \\nsuch as market trends, weather predictions, etc\\n\\nUnsupervised Machine Learning\\nIn unsupervised machine learning, the machine is trained using the unlabeled dataset, and the machine predicts \\nthe output without any supervision. In unsupervised learning, the models are trained with data that is neither \\nclassified nor labelled, and the model acts on that data without any supervision.The main aim of the \\nunsupervised learning algorithm is to group or categorize the unsorted dataset according to the similarities, \\npatterns, and differences.
